# MicroImage Project

This project is designed to process microscope images using Python and OpenCV. It provides functionalities such as image stitching, ROI selection, digital zoom, and auto-focus simulation to enhance the analysis of microscopic images.

## Features

- **Image Stitching**: Combine multiple overlapping microscope images into a single high-resolution image.
- **ROI Selection**: Extract a specific region of interest (ROI) from an image for detailed analysis.
- **Digital Zoom**: Magnify selected regions (10X or 20X) using bilinear or bicubic interpolation.
- **Auto-Focus Simulation**: Enhance image clarity using contrast-based sharpening techniques.
